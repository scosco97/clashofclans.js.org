To create a client, you need to create an account on [Clash Of Clans API](https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/getting-started).

To login with your own keys, generate the keys by entering your ip with your key options.

### Basic Client ###
Basic Client that creates connection with your created keys

    // Initialize the API Client
    import { Client } from 'clashofclans.js';
    const clashClient = new Client({
        keys: ['***']
    });
```
